This is a document where you can write ideas that you have!

Ideas:
    - Add trains!
    - Add characters that can be controlled

Improvements:
    - PixelWindow should never be called directly: add a wrapper function located in Graphics

Known bugs (that aren't critical):
    - If the turn of a ThickLine is too steep, the extra padding that is added could fall outside of the screen
    - The orientation of the padding of ThickLine should be correct every time - a developer should never have to manually set flipCorner
    - isLeftOfPlane in Pos can cause a division by 0
