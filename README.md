# train-city
This is a transit diagram of the fictional city "Train City". Daily, the members of "tåget" (a student group at LTH) vote on a new location to add. The new location is then, courtesy of the TågMeister, beautifully added to a vector image of the transit diagram. This repository aims to bring that vector image to life.

The project was inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/TransitDiagrams/.
